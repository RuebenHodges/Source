                <article>As a private practitioner, Daniel represents litigants in the Wayne

                    and Oakland County Juvenile and Probate Court systems. Daniel serves
                    
                    as the Secretary to the Wayne County Juvenile Trial Lawyers
                    
                    Association and is the past chair of the Oakland County Bar
                    
                    Association’s Juvenile Law Committee.
                    
                    
                    Daniel formed Mercier Development LLC to realize a lifelong
                    
                    dream of redeveloping one of Detroit’s historic buildings into housing
                    
                    units, following in his family’s footsteps of creating housing for Wayne
                    
                    County residents. In 2003, Daniel realized his dream when he was
                    
                    awarded the bid to purchase Detroit’s historic Lafer Building; a
                    
                    nine–story building located on Broadway Street in downtown Detroit. 
                    
                    He converted the building into housing units by creating a debt/equity
                    
                    financial package that was replicated by other downtown investors
                    
                    spurring the redevelopment of Detroit’s historical buildings over the past
                    
                    decade.</article>
